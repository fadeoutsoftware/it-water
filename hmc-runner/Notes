1)Need to check ont the second stage if we can safely remove the APT stuff

2)Mount example volumes, so far libraries and executable seems ok 

Useful command (within this folder..)
build image: 
docker build -t hmc-runner .

re-build all:
docker build --progress=plain --no-cache .

re-build all and save the output in a separated file build.log:
docker build --progress=plain --no-cache . > build.log

Open a bash shell in the container 
docker exec -it [container_id] ---user root /bin/bash
